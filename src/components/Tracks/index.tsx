              One of the most challenging things about a hackathon can be
              developing your final submission, especially for hackers who are
              aiming to build their design skills, sharing their ideas and
              stories through visuals and experiences. This can often lead to
              people feeling left out or discouraged from even entering their
              first hackathon, especially if you’re entering on your own. For
              all you designers, we’re hosting prizes and workshops to help
              support your no-code solutions and prototypes.
